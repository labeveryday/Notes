# MYSQL Notes

To get started you need mysql and mysql workbench
- Workbench is a gui that allows you to view you database
- [Install mysql on Mac](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/osx-installation-pkg.html)
- [Cheat Sheet](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-cheat-sheet.aspx)

Once installed add mysql to your path
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin
```

To log into mysql from bash
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Backing up your database
```bash
mysql -u root -p devicesdb > devicesdb_database_backup.sql
```

You can change your mysql password once logged in
```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('password')
```

## Create, Modify and Delete 

Create a database if it does not exist

```sql
CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] labeveryday_database;
```

Change to the database

```sql
USE labeveryday_database
```

Delete the database if it exists

```sql
DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] labeveryday_database;
```

Create a table if it does not exist

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
  column_list
);
```

Add a column to a table

```sql
ALTER TABLE routers ADD [IF NOT EXISTS] serial_number VARCHAR(255) AFTER hostname;
```

Another example of adding a column

```sql
IF NOT EXISTS( SELECT NULL
            FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
           WHERE table_name = 'tablename'
             AND table_schema = 'db_name'
             AND column_name = 'columnname')  THEN

  ALTER TABLE `TableName` ADD `ColumnName` int(1) NOT NULL default '0';

END IF;
```

Create a Database, Table and insert into a table

```sql
CREATE DATABASE inventory;
USE inventory;
CREATE TABLE routers (hostname VARCHAR(255), ip VARCHAR(255));
INSERT INTO routers VALUES ('r1.example.com', '192.168.1.1');
INSERT INTO routers VALUES ('r2.example.com', '192.168.1.2');
INSERT INTO routers VALUES ('r3.example.com', '192.168.1.3');
```


## Viewing Data in MYSQL

Show SQL version

```sql
select version()
```

view mysql databases
```sql
show databases;
```

view tables

```sql
SHOW tables;
```

view table scheme

```sql
DESCRIBE routers;
```

View entries in a table

```sql
SELECT * FROM inventory.routers;
```

view 10 entries in the database
```sql
select * from routers limit 10;
```

view total table count;
```sql
select count(*) from routers;
```

view total table count and temporarily rename column
```sql
select count(*) as Total from routers;
```

view two different columns and search criteria
```sql
select count(*) as Total, location as Location from routers GROUP BY location;
```

view two different columns, search criteria and sort
```sql
select count(*) as Total, location as Location from routers GROUP BY location ORDER BY Total;
```

view two different columns, search, criteria, sort and limit
```sql
select count(*) as Total, location as Location from routers GROUP BY location ORDER BY Total desc limit 10;
```

view two different columns, search, criteria, sort and limit
```sql
select count(*) as Total, location as Location from routers GROUP BY location HAVING Total >= 50 Order by Total Desc;
```

## Python and Mysql

install mysql-connector
```bash
pip install mysql-connector
```

# mysql and docker

When creating a mysql container you will need to also create a persistent volume for your container. This is so data will be present when stopping and stopping your container.

'''
docker run --env MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes --net my_network_name --ip 192.168.0.200 -v ~/working_directory/db:/var/lib/mysql -it mysql:5.7
