# Understanding APIs ( Application Programming Interface )

An API is an Application Programming Interface

- Think of an API as a middle man that gives software the ability to communicate with another software.
- You have ACI and you have Python. In order to write code for ACI there is an API that exposes in order for you to communicate directly with ACI.
- API's use a URI

>NOTE: An API enforces that communication to return exactly what you expect.

REST - Representational State Transfer

- Is simple a way to use HTTP
- In order words it's a API that is build on HTTP.
- When you open your browser and type www.labeveryday.com you are sending a GET request to dns which is doing the same for the labeveryday server.
  
- This is how REST APIs work.
  - RESTful is how you design a rest API
  - HTTP Request - Headers and Payload
  - HTTP Response - Headers and Payload
